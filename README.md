MATLAB codes I wrote solely for my interest

Codes:
- multi_DOF_vibrataion: 
  this is a code I wrote after taking System Dynamics course.
  it deals with series of masses connected (1D) by spring.
  the system of differential equations is dealt by similarity transformation,
  and the solution is output as a .gif file.
  
  an exmaple .gif files is attached with.
